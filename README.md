# Solve-git-github.com-Permission-denied-publickey-.-and-Remove-big-file-from-history

Sure! Here's a clean overview of both parts you're asking for:

---

## ✅ **Overview of Solving `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)`**  
**(Solution by Abdul, simplified)**

This error usually happens when GitHub can't verify your SSH key. Here's how Abdul solved it:

### 🔧 **Steps:**

1. **Start the SSH Agent**
   ```bash
   eval $(ssh-agent -s) / "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" --login -i

   ```
   ➤ This starts the background service that handles your SSH keys.

2. **Add your SSH private key**
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/saddamnvn /  ssh-add "$HOME\.ssh\saddamnvn"

   ```
   ➤ This adds your custom SSH key (`saddamnvn`) to the agent so GitHub can use it.

3. **Test GitHub SSH connection**
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   ➤ You should see:
   > *Hi Saddam-Hossen! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.*

---

### ✅ Then continue with Git commands:

4. **Pull latest changes**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

5. **Stage all changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

6. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "your comment"
   ```

7. **Push your code**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## 🧹 **Overview of Removing a Large File from Git History (`attendance.tar`)**

GitHub blocks files over **100 MB**, and your `attendance.tar` is ~475 MB. Even if removed from the folder, **it still exists in history** — so you must clean it.

### 🔥 Step-by-step Fix:

1. **Untrack the large file**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached attendance.tar
   ```

2. **Ignore it forever**
   ```bash
   echo "attendance.tar" >> .gitignore
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Remove attendance.tar and added to .gitignore"
   ```

3. **Delete it from all previous commits**
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch attendance.tar" \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

4. **Force push cleaned repo**
   ```bash
   git push origin --force
   ```

|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Permission denied (publickey)     | Start SSH agent → Add key → Test with `ssh -T git@github.com`       |
| Large file (>100MB) blocks push   | Remove file from history using `filter-branch`, then force push     |




Got it — you're saying that **every time you open Git Bash or try Git commands**, you need to run:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/saddamnvn /  ssh-add "$HOME\.ssh\saddamnvn"

```

That’s annoying 😅 — let’s **make it automatic**, so your SSH key is **added once** and remembered.

---

## ✅ Solution: Automatically Load SSH Key at Startup (Windows + Git Bash)

### 🧩 Step 1: Add Key to `~/.bash_profile`

1. Open Git Bash.
2. Run:

```bash
nano ~/.bash_profile
```

3. Add the following lines at the end:

```bash
# Start SSH agent and add key automatically
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/saddamnvn
```

4. Save the file:
   - Press `Ctrl + O` to write the file
   - Press `Enter` to confirm
   - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit

---

### 🧪 Step 2: Restart Git Bash

Close Git Bash, open it again, and you should see:
```
Agent pid XXXX
Identity added: /c/Users/01957/.ssh/saddamnvn
```

That means your key is loaded and you won’t have to type `ssh-add` again.

---

### ✅ Bonus (Optional): Use `Windows ssh-agent` instead (No Git Bash needed)

If you want this to work **system-wide (including IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.)**:

1. **Enable the Windows SSH Agent:**
   ```powershell
   Start-Service ssh-agent
   Set-Service -Name ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
   ```

2. **Add your key permanently:**
   ```powershell
   ssh-add C:\Users\01957\.ssh\saddamnvn /  ssh-add "$HOME\.ssh\saddamnvn"

   ```

   This will remember it between reboots 🎉

---





That error usually means the `ssh-agent` service is either **not installed**, **disabled**, or you need **admin privileges** to start it.

Let’s go step-by-step to fix this and get it working system-wide:

---

## 🧰 Fix for: "Cannot start service ssh-agent"

### ✅ Step 1: Open PowerShell **as Administrator**

1. Click `Start`
2. Type `PowerShell`
3. Right-click on **Windows PowerShell**
4. Select **"Run as administrator"**

You'll know it's working if the window title says **Administrator: Windows PowerShell**.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Enable and Start `ssh-agent` Service

Now run these commands **in that admin PowerShell**:

```powershell
Get-Service ssh-agent
```

Check its status. If it's **Disabled**, do the following:

```powershell
Set-Service -Name ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service ssh-agent
```

If you get no errors, the service should now be running and auto-started on reboot 🎉

---

### ✅ Step 3: Add Your SSH Key Permanently

Now, run this command (replace path with your actual key if different):

```powershell
ssh-add C:\Users\01957\.ssh\saddamnvn /  ssh-add "$HOME\.ssh\saddamnvn"

```

It should say something like:

```
Identity added: C:\Users\01957\.ssh\saddamnvn
```

This will now **persist across sessions**.

---

## 🧪 Test It

Now close your terminal and try:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see:

```
Hi Saddam-Hossen! You've successfully authenticated...
```


Thanks for the update — the issue is almost solved, but Git is still not using your correct SSH key when pulling.

You are authenticated (`ssh -T` worked), but `git pull` is failing — meaning **your SSH key works**, but Git isn't picking it up.

---

### ✅ Let’s **force Git** to use the correct SSH key with debug output

Please try this:

```powershell
GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" git pull origin main
```

This will show a **verbose debug log** of the SSH connection and reveal **which key Git is trying to use**.

---

### 🔍 From the verbose log, please look for:

- Lines like:
  ```
  Offering public key: C:/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_rsa
  Offering public key: C:/Users/YourName/.ssh/saddamnvn
  ```
- Or:
  ```
  Authenticated with partial success.
  No more authentication methods available.
  ```

Please copy and paste just the **last 15–20 lines** here (if you're okay with that) — no private info will be exposed.

---

### 🛠️ Alternative Quick Fix (Test)

Try setting the remote using **HTTPS** instead of SSH if you're okay using username/token:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Saddam-Hossen/userServiceMicroService.git
```

Then:
```powershell
git pull origin main
```

It will ask for username/token instead of using SSH.

Let me know what you prefer — we can keep going with SSH or switch to HTTPS.
